# CodeHiveUI

The front end is written in React. Most styling will be done through TailwindCSS.

## Local Setup

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

- Run the ui
```
npm run dev
```
